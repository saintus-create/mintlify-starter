<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher
  - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Documentation Platform on your operating system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Documentation Platform CLI">

```bash
npm i -g docs-cli
```
</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
docs-cli dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Documentation Platform uses port 3000. You can customize the port Documentation Platform runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Documentation Platform on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
docs-cli dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Documentation Platform on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Documentation Platform versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Documentation Platform. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm docs-cli update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
docs-cli broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed." style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g docs-cli`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g docs-cli`
